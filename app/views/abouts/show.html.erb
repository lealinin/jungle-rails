<h1>About</h1>

<p>
I started my business almost by accident. Little characters I doodled to amuse myself during advertising 
meetings at my day job, took on a surprising life of their own. After I was laid off and gave birth to my 
daughter, what were once diversions became the foundation for a new business idea. I launched my shop in 
2018 with just a few products and I have been adding more products each year.
